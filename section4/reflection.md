## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I was doing this before, so not much different.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
You estimated that this section would take 10-14 hours. Even with padding my estimate of how long it took, it only took me 5-6 hours.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Like an array, an object can hold sets of data. However, while an array is an ordered list of data, an object is more complex, can hold arrays in it's properties. The sets of data within an object can be called on using a String (not just the index of an array). You can also create Classes to create objects (like a cookie cutter), and create functions within a class to act on the objects.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - An Array because each item is a simple string.
  * List of states and their capitals - An Array, because the state name and capital can be entered as one string, and it'd just be a list.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - An Array: it's a list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - An array. Again, a list.
  * List of student names and their cohort - An Object. Though this could be done in an array, the cohort a student is in could change, so I think it would be easier (and allow other things to be done/added) as an object.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - An Object. In making a cake, there are different things to do (functions) at different points in time.
  * All my favorite restaurants - Could be an array (a simple list of your favourite restaurants), or an object if things like type of restaurant, price point, address, etc are included.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? online job application. Sample keys include: name, email, phone number, etc. The values would be the applicant's personal data for those keys.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Can you add a key to a class/object outside of the declaration of it?
