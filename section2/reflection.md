## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I generally wait too long, due to gifted child syndrome and thinking that I should be able to figure things out myself. But I've been working on being kinder to myself and asking for help (in all areas) when I need it.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
It was a little uncomfortable to start with because I couldn't fully remember how to run in node. But I feel good that I was able to figure everything out. And I'm glad for this because some friends and I were just talking about how we didn't know how to study in school.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is where something is compared and a true or false is returned, with different code blocks/tasks being executed depending on the result (example if or if else statements).
Real life: If I get up with my alarm, I will make it to work on time, else I will sleep in and be late.
Web app: If I hover over a movie image on Netflix, it will enlarge and display more details.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You can nest if else statements, or add else if statements that are chained to a previous if statement.
If condition 1 is true, then this happens. Else (if it was false), if condition 2 is true, then X happens. Else (if conditions 1&2 were false), if condition 3 is true, then Y happens. If ALL of those are false (the final else), then Z happens.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
You can use a function with a logical operator. && or ||. Another option is to use an if else statement with the logical operator.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Are there more complex if statements, or do they only get more complex by adding additional layers of `else if` statements?
