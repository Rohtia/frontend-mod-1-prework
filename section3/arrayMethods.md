`pop`
  Like popping a balloon
  this method pops the last element (the last item on the list) off of the array and returns it

`push`
  Pushes the length of the array along a number line
  This adds the item (or items) to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array.

`shift`
  Like pop, but at the front of the array.
  removes the first element of the array and returns it.

`unshift`
  The opposite of `shift`
  This adds one (or more) elements to the start of the array and returns the new length of the array.


**Of these four, the methods that *remove* an element return the value of that element. The methods that *add* an element return the new length of the array**
