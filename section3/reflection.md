## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The Zone of Proximal Development was new to me, but it seems to make sense, and I like it. 
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I am learning this all on my own, so obviously looking to grow. Though I'm not sure how willing I'll be to tackle challenges once this becomes more difficult.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
