## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I already have a growth mindset, wanting to learn more.
I will start (I already have) working in SHORT focused bursts, and then taking frequent, short breaks a la the Pomodoro method.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  a. Numbers: various kinds of numbers that can be used in calculations.
  b. Strings: words, sentences, or series of letters, numbers, and special characters.
  c. Boolean: comparison equations that result in a 'true' or 'false'.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// turns everything after it on a line into a comment.
/* and */ turns everything between them into a multi line comment block.
Comments are used to explain your reasoning for how you wrote the code, to make your code easier to read.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
It is information that is needed to run the script, but the information can be different each time the script is run.
  It's like food. You have food every day, but the KIND of food changes each time you eat.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Gmail.
var emailAddress would be a string
var password would be a string.
var email1Read would be boolean for whether it is read or unread.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is adding together different strings and numbers that are turned into one larger string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Netflix, recommended for you.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Should we use strict equality checks most of the time?
Should we use interpolation over concatenation more often than not? And why is concatenation not an easier word?
